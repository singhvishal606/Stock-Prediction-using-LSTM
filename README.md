# Stock-Prediction-using-LSTM
This Project studies the usage of LSTM networks on prediction of stock prices, to predict future trends of stock prices based on the price history, alongside with moving averages. For that goal, a prediction model was built, and a series of experiments were executed and theirs results analysed against RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
